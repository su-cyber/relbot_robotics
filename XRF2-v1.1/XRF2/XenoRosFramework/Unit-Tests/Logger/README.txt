1) Running this code will create a UT_Logger[data & time].bin file.
2) Use the binairy_to_csv or the binairy_to_mat python code to convertthe binairy to a .csv or .mat file.
3) Check the data result should be for the names of the coloms : "this_is_a_int","this_is_a_double","this_is_a_float","this_is_a_char","this_is_a_bool"
    For the data contained in the coloms:
        "this_is_a_int"     : Starting from 0, increasing by 1 
        "this_is_a_double"  : Starting from 100, which each line devided by 4
        "this_is_a_float"   : Starting from 10, which each line devied by 2
        "this_is_a_char"    : Starting with R, every three line should spell RAM
        "this_is_a_bool"    : Starting with false, should be inverted with each line
