# XenoRosFramework

This repository provides a framework that allows developers to implement firm real-time tasks on Xenomai while establishing communication with ROS2. It consists of the framework, code for the icoboard, and templates for the framework.

## Framework Structure

The **XenoRosFramework** folder contains the framework, which is divided into the following categories:

### 1. Common
This category includes files used in both ROS and Xenomai or for instrumentation purposes. 

- **Custom Message Types:**  
  The files that the end-user needs to modify within the framework are in this category, specifically the custom message types:  
  - `Ros2Xeno`  
  - `Xeno2Ros`

- **Debugging:**  
  Debug messages for the framework can be activated by changing the debug value from `0` to `1` in the `debug_settings.h` file. These use precompile options, so the code must be recompiled after each change.

### 2. ROS
This category contains files related to ROS, including:
- ROS nodes
- Messages

These files can be compiled into standalone ROS programs.

### 3. Xenomai
This category includes files required for:
- Classes implemented on a Xenomai kernel or firm real-time thread.

Files in this category cannot be compiled into standalone programs.

### 4. UnitTests
This category contains various small programs for unit testing. These unit tests help the end-user determine whether an error is due to the framework or their implementation.

## Templates

Two types of templates are provided:
1. **Base Template:**  
   Does not require additional code to function.
2. **20-sim Template:**  
   Requires code generated by 20-sim to function.

## Additional Resources

For more detailed information about the framework and its use, see the Software-Tools Manual, especially Appendix I. 

More information about the design and background of the framework are in [Raoudi2024MSc.pdf](https://essay.utwente.nl/104808/). Appendix F of the report provides details about implementing one of the templates.
